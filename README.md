# Modularize html boilerplate
This boilerplate repo uses the [modularize-html](https://github.com/jeroentvb/modularize-html) package, which uses [ejs](https://ejs.co/#docs) to allow building a static website from modular ejs (HTML) files. The main goal is to enable a developers to create a static site in a modular way. It's also meant to be as simple as possible, while applying some best practices at build.   
It can also minify js & css, and encode png and jpeg files to webp on build.

## Installation
Install using the following commands
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jeroentvb/modularize-html-boilerplate.git
cd modularize-html-boilerplate
npm install
```

## Usage
Next, run `npm run create-config`. This creates the necessary config file. Ater that you can run `npm run dev`, and start developing.

Build your website in the [src](src/) folder. The page templates should go in [src/pages](src/pages). Partials/components can go into [src/partials](src/partials). A head and tail file are already there and linked to the index page.

To start the dev server run `npm run dev`.

## Config
There are a few configurable options for modularize-html in `modularize-html-config.json`.
### build.minify.js
*Boolean*  
Minify the JavaScript files on build.

### build.minify.css
*Boolean*  
Minify the CSS files on build.

### build.encodeImagesWebp
*Boolean*  
Encode `.jpg` and `.png` images to `.webp` on build. More info [here](#webp-images).

### build.pageTitle.home
*String*  
`<title>` for the `index.html` file.

### build.pageTitle.suffix
*String*  
Suffix for the page `<title>`. Can be empty.

### development.removeWebpSources
*Boolean*  
Remove `.webp` `<source>` tags from a `<picture>` element while running the dev server. More info [here](#webp-images).

### development.staticSite
*Boolean*  
Send message to the browser if the link navigate to doesn't contain `.html`. That means it's not linked in the html with `.html` and won't work as a static site.  
If you are planning on hosting the pages on a web server, you won't need to do so, because the server should resolve the url.

### sass
*Boolean*
To use scss while developing, set this to true. Entry file is `styles.scss`.

## Development
To develop the website, this app uses a simple [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) server. To run the dev server enter `npm run dev` in the terminal.

### New page
To create a new page use `npm run new-page pagename`. Where `pagename` would be the name of your page. This creates a new template with the head and tail already linked.

### Page titles
The page titles are based on the filenames. The only exception being index(.html), which can be set in the [config](#build.pageTitle.home). You can put a suffix behind the title, also found in the [config](#build.pageTitle.suffix). If you want to use a custom page title, you must add your own `<head>` and __not__ use the default `head.ejs`.

### webp images
While developing you can enable the options under the `webp` key in the config to develop your website without having to worry about compiling images to `.webp` format. This is done in the build step if `encodeImages` is set to `true`.  
If you'd like to use `.webp` images in the final build, it's recommended to use the provided `image-jpg.ejs` or `image-png.ejs` templates. Alternatively you can link your `.webp` sources manually.

### Linking html files
Linking to another file is the same as you would in a static html file, so link to `/index.html`.  
Also see the [development.staticSite](#development.staticSite) config option.

### CSS preprocessor
You can use your own css preprocessor if you so desire. Just make sure changes in your source file are being watched and compiled a css file and make sure it's linked in [head.ejs](src/partials/head.ejs), or your custom `<head>`. Otherwise changes won't show up or be included in the compiled website.

### JS minify/transpile
You can use your own js transpiler if you so desire. Just make sure it's compiled and linked in [tail.ejs](src/partials/tail.ejs), or anywhere else, before compiling the website.

### Build the website
If you are done you can build the website using `npm run build`. This will copy the assets folder to a newly created `dist` folder. It also compiles the ejs templates and creates an html file in the `dist`.
